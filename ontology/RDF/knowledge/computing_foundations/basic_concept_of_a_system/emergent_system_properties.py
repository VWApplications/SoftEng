                A system is more than simply the sum of its parts. Thus, the
                properties of a system are not simply the sum of the properties of
                its components. Instead, a system often exhibits properties that
                are properties of the system as a whole. These properties are
                called emergent properties because they develop only after the
                integration of constituent parts in the system. Emergent system
                properties can be either functional or nonfunctional. Functional
                properties describe the things that a system does. For example, an
                aircraftâ€™s functional properties include flotation on air, carrying
                people or cargo, and use as a weapon of mass destruction.
                Nonfunctional properties describe how the system behaves in its operational
                environment. These can include such qualities as consistency, capacity, weight,
                security, etc.
