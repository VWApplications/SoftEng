                Encapsulation is a mechanism used to implement abstraction.
                When we are dealing with one level of abstraction, the
                information concerning the levels below and above that level is
                encapsulated. This information can be the concept, problem, or
                observable phenomenon; or it may be the permissible operations
                on these relevant entities. Encapsulation usually comes with
                some degree of information hiding in which some or all of the
                underlying details are hidden from the level above the
                interface provided by the abstraction. To an object,
                information hiding means we donâ€™t need to know the details of
                how the object is represented or how the operations on those
                objects are implemented.
