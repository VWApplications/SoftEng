Input and output are the interfaces between users and software.  Software is
useless without input and output. Humans design software to process some input
and produce desirable output.  All software engineers must consider input and
output as an integral part of the software product they engineer or develop.
Issues considered for input include (but are not limited to): What input is
required? How is the input passed from users to computers? What is the most
convenient way for users to enter input? What format does the computer require
of the input data? The designer should request the minimum data from human
input, only when the data is not already stored in the system.  The designer
should format and edit the data at the time of entry to reduce errors arising
from incorrect or malicious data entry. For output, we need to consider what
the users wish to see: In what format would users like to see output? What is
the most pleasing way to display output? If the party interacting with the
software isnâ€™t human but another software or computer or control system, then
we need to consider the input/output type and format that the software should
produce to ensure proper data exchange between systems. There are many rules of
thumb for developers to follow to produce good input/output for a software.
